# Tick-EAT BOT
## Discord.py bot for ticketing...

## Features
#### The bot can be used for bulk clearing messages and also for ticketing of course

## How to use it
#### To use the bot just create a Category in your discord guild and allow the bot to send messages and manage channels. After doing that create a role named Admin with all staff members who you want to answer members tickets.
#### After you have done that you just have to use the command or ^ticket for creating a ticket and the bot will create a ticket for you. However to close the ticket just type the command ^close and the ticket will be closed.
#### To replace the bot with your bot just change the last line of code in bot.py and instead of bot.run(os.environ('DISCORD_TOKEN')) put Your own bot token using bot.run('Your token')
